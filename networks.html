  <p>A computer network is when a bunch of computers and devices are connected so they can share stuff like messages, games, or files. It’s kind of like when we’re all in a group chat and can talk to each other at the same time. At school, the computers being connected to the same printer or the internet is part of a network too. They’re all linked together so they can send things like pictures, videos, or homework back and forth. It’s how we play online games with others or watch videos on the internet. Without networks, computers wouldn’t be able to “talk” to each other or connect to the web.</p>
