<h1>Fiber Based Systems</h1>
<p>Fiber-based systems use really thin glass or plastic strands, called fiber optics, to send information using light. This makes stuff like internet and phone calls way faster and clearer, even if itâ€™s going really far.They can also be used to sense things like heat or movement, which helps in places like bridges or hospitals. Sometimes, it just means materials made from strong or natural fibers, like in sports equipment or eco-friendly packaging.</p>
