<h1>Copper Based Systems</h1>
<p>A copper-based system is when copper wires are used to carry electricity or data, like in phone chargers or internet cables. Copper is good at this because it lets electricity flow easily. We still use copper a lot because itâ€™s cheap, strong, and easy to bend. Even though there are newer ways to send data, copper still works really well for most stuff.</p>
