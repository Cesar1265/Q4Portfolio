<h1>Wireless Based Systems</h1>
<p>A wireless-based system is when things like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or phones send signals through the air instead of using wires. It’s how we can use the internet, play games, or text people without being plugged in. It’s super useful because you can move around and still stay connected. Like when you use wireless headphones or connect your phone to a speaker without any cords. It makes life easier since you don’t have to worry about wires getting in the way.</p>
