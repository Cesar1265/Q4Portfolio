<h1>Summary!</h1>
<p>Copper-based, wireless-based, and fiber-based systems are all ways to send data. Copper-based systems use copper wires to carry power or information, like in phone chargers or old internet cables. Copper works alright, but it's not the fastest. Wireless-based systems doesn't need wires. They send signals through the air, like when you use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Fiber-based systems are the fastest because they use tiny glass wires to send data as light, which makes the internet fast and clear. </p>
